Water is the most important of sources, vital for sustaining all kinds of life; however, it is in constant threat of pollution by life itself. Water is one of the most communicable mediums with a far reach. Rapid industrialization has consequently led to deterioration of water quality at an alarming rate. Poor water quality results have been known to be one of the major factors of escalation of harrowing diseases. As reported, in developing countries, 80% of the diseases are water borne diseases, which have led to 5 million deaths and 2.5 billion illnesses.
Water quality is currently estimated through expensive and time-consuming lab and statistical analyses, which require sample collection, transport to labs, and a considerable amount of time and calculation, which is quite ineffective given water is quite a communicable medium and time is of the essence if water is polluted with disease-inducing waste. The horrific consequences of water pollution necessitate a quicker and cheaper alternative.
In this regard, the main motivation this model tries to provide alternative method based on supervised machine learning for the efficient prediction of water quality in real-time.
